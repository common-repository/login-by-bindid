== FAQ ==

= What level of security does BindID provide? =

BindID uses FIDO-based biometrics combined with the common OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard to provide secure authentication to web services. 

= Can the login experience be customized to match my site? =

The login button provided by BindID is fixed. At this time, customization is not supported.

= What would be the experience for existing users after BindID plugin is enabled in my WordPress website? = 

BindID users are associated with subscribers using their email address, which is included in the BindID ID token for every login. New subscribers are added to the WordPress site when a user logs in using BindID and their email address doesnâ€™t correspond to an existing user.
